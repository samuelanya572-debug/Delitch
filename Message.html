          Dear Delitch,<br>
        Happy Birthday 🎊, so um where do i even start, Firstly I love, care and appreciate you a lot💖 and i know i don't ever say it or show it mostly cus you'll act like it's not a human being that said it 🤧but i really do and i love alot of things about you,
        like your smile, i love how comfortable you've become around me, i love that you want like a deeper connection with me(i think😶‍🌫️) , i love how you always let yourself feel your emotions even though i'm the complete opposite but we are getting there sha,
        i love that you feel that you can talk to me about almost anything(i said almost intentionlly abeg), i love that your trenches babe personality even tho we both know you speak white washed pidgin, i love that you are finally embracing the social media  influencer in you,
         i love how far you've brought our friendship.Honestly i just love you mehn and i know that you'll still come and ask me to tell you what i love about you on another day so lemme just end it here. But i appreciate you for the time you've spent with me as my homegirl, whether its you coming to rant or chopping dry milo and kilishi or even beans🤣, to our arguments both serious and unserious, each of those moments will always be with me(plus i'm the one with a retentive memory here) and also for your care even tho you'll not tell me that you care about me Naledi🫠 but it's fine i know you do and finally to your ragebaitt ability which i will not fall for sha. 
        And on this day, i pray that the Lord will grant all your heart desires and that anything you put your mind towards will prosper. i love you(bruh i've said this like how many times🫠 and also i know you like me but i can't prove it yet👀.) Enjoy your day girly, you deserve it.<br>
        
         <sub>(P.S - Theres no way im making a website for someone on their birthday, thats how you know how special you are to me🙂.)</sub><br>

         Your homeboy,
         Samuel 🙊<br>
